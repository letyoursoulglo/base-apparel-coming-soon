## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

The most important thing I've learned while completing this challenge was how to effectively use media queries when developing a responsive website. As a beginner with coding, I struggled for a bit trying with that concept. With this project I took the mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

With this project Javascript was barely used, however I will continue to develop my skills. However I can say the Javascript concepts I've learned in my studies have clicked.
